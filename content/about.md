## Introduction

RIP is the Instruction Pointer of 64-Bit CPUs and he is interupting vector 0x80, on linux systems we use this for system_calls.
The pseudo name was created when I read the Book "The Art of Exploitation" since few years and handle with the EIP on 64-Bit systems :-).

I love the linux system and uses Gentoo if I have a lot of time and for security proposes. But when I have some trouble in the year I switch to Arch Linux... 
because I have not 45min to compile the newest firefox.

I use this blog to remember me what I have done and how I had done. So some articles are not for uneducated readers and not all stuff is for the security section. 

When I not coding or do other interessting stuff on computer then I driving motorbikes and do some sports or reading.
Well, I hope you find some stuff for you on this upcomming website. Because my time limitations I canot maintain the programms and code I have written. So you must do it yourself.
